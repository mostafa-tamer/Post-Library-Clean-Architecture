**Functional Requirements:**

The app should have two tabs (Post and Favorites).

The posts tab should have the following behavior:
The posts tab will display a list of posts from the network.
The list of posts should be available even if the network is not available.
A message should notify the user if the internet is not available.
On clicking a post, it should open a detail screen which will have a list of comments for the post.
The details tab should have a button that lets you add to favorites.

The favorites tab should have the following behavior:
Favorite tabs will list all the posts that have been added to favorites by the user.
If the user favorites the item when the device is offline, it should sync the favorite to the server as soon as the device comes back online (No API calls, just do the functionality of syncing the favorites to the server).
